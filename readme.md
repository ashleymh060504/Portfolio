# <Portfolio>

## Description

This repository built a Portfolio page to showcase my skills and talents. As a bootcamp student, this is a work in progress.

## Usage

Once you've navigated to the site, you can click on each of the 4 links in the nav bar at the top to jump to those sections on the page: About Me, Work, Contact Me, and Resume. As they are completed you will find portfolio links to my work, which you can click to visit the deployed web pages. I've included my contact information toward the bottom and I am currently undecided as to how I will present my resume.
